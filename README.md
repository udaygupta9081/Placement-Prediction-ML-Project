# Placement Prediction using Machine Learning

This project analyzes a student placement dataset and builds a machine learning model to predict placement outcomes based on CGPA and IQ.

## Dataset
- Features: CGPA, IQ
- Target: Placement (0 = Not Placed, 1 = Placed)

## Libraries Used
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Workflow
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Train-test split
- Machine learning model training and evaluation

## Objective
To implement an end-to-end binary classification ML project on real data.
